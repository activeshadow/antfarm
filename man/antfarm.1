.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
ANTFARM (Advanced Network Toolkit For Assessments and Remote Mapping) is a passive network mapping application that utilizes output from existing network examination tools to populate its OSI\-modeled database\. This data can then be used to form a \'picture\' of the network being analyzed\.
.
.P
ANTFARM can also be described as a data fusion tool that does not directly interact with the network\. The analyst can use a variety of passive or active data gathering techniques, the outputs of which are loaded into ANTFARM and incorporated into the network map\. Data gathering can be limited to completely passive techniques when minimizing the risk of disrupting the operational network is a concern\.
.
.SH "DISCLAIMER"
While the ANTFARM tool itself is completely passive (it does not have any built\-in means of gathering data directly from devices or networks), network admin tools that users of ANTFARM may choose to gather data with may or may not be passive\. The authors of ANTFARM hold no responsibility in how users decide to gather data they wish to feed into ANTFARM\.
.
.SH "FILES"
Unless it already exists, a \'\.antfarm\' directory is created in the current user\'s home directory\. This directory will contain a default configuration file, the SQLite3 database used by ANTFARM (if the user specifies for SQLite3 to be used, which is also the default), and log files generated when using ANTFARM\. Custom plugins created by users will be made available to the ANTFARM application when they are placed in the \'\.antfarm/plugins\' directory\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
ANTFARM\'s default method of operation is to parse input data or generate output data using a specified plugin\. The plugin to use is specified on the command line as a sub\-command, and each plugin developed specifies it\'s own required arguments\. Global ANTFARM options include:
.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-env\fR \fIenv\fR
The ANTFARM environment to use when executing the given sub\-command\. The default environment is \'antfarm\'\. Setting the environment variable affects things like database used, log file used and configuration settings used\.
.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-log\-level\fR \fIlevel\fR
The log level used when executing the given sub\-command\. Optional levels include debug, info, warn, error and fatal\. The default log level used is \'warn\'\.
.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-prefix\fR \fIprefix\fR
The default subnet prefix used when IP interfaces are created using IP address data that does not include subnet mask information\. The default prefix used is 30\.
