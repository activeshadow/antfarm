.SH "DESCRIPTION"
ANTFARM (Advanced Network Toolkit For Assessments and Remote Mapping) is a
passive network mapping application that utilizes output from existing network
examination tools to populate its OSI\-modeled database. This data can then be
used to form a ‘picture’ of the network being analyzed.
.
.P
ANTFARM can also be described as a data fusion tool that does not directly
interact with the network. The analyst can use a variety of passive or active
data gathering techniques, the outputs of which are loaded into ANTFARM and
incorporated into the network map. Data gathering can be limited to completely
passive techniques when minimizing the risk of disrupting the operational
network is a concern.
.
.SH "DISCLAIMER"
While the ANTFARM tool itself is completely passive (it does not have any
built\-in means of gathering data directly from devices or networks), network
admin tools that users of ANTFARM may choose to gather data with may or may not
be passive. The authors of ANTFARM hold no responsibility in how users decide to
gather data they wish to feed into ANTFARM.
.
.SH "FILES"
Unless it already exists, a '.antfarm' directory is created in the current
user's home directory. This directory will contain a default configuration file,
the SQLite3 database used by ANTFARM (if the user specifies for SQLite3 to be
used, which is also the default), and log files generated when using ANTFARM.
Custom plugins created by users will be made available to the ANTFARM
application when they are placed in the '.antfarm/plugins' directory.
.
.P
Each plugin developed for ANTFARM specifies the input and/or output requirements
when being used. To see what inputs are required for a particular plugin, type:

.SH "OPTIONS"
ANTFARM's default method of operation is to parse input data or generate output
data using a specified plugin. The plugin to use is specified on the command
line as a sub\-command, and each plugin developed specifies it's own required
arguments. Global ANTFARM commands include:
.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-env\fR \fIenv\fR
The ANTFARM environment to use when executing the given sub\-command. The
default environment is 'antfarm'. Setting the environment variable affects
things like database used, log file used and configuration settings used.
.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-log\-level\fR \fIlevel\fR
The log level used when executing the given sub\-command. Optional levels
include debug, info, warn, error and fatal. The default log level used is
'warn'.
